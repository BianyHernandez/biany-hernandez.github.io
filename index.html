              <p>   One of my hero’s or someone that I look up to the most in my life is Maya Angelou because while I was growing up I had always wanted to become a poet and an artist and Maya had always encouraged people when she was alive and even after she has passed away. When I was younger I had wanted to become a poet but I thought I wasn’t good enough to become one so I decided to choose another path but i still hope to achieve my dream and I'm still practicing on improving on how to make my poems better by having more of an emotional connection to what I write because people could be able to relate to it. Maya had been through a lot in life especially when she was a young girl because she had been sexually assaulted by her mother’s boyfriend and he was arrested and convicted but was released a day later and a few days later he was found dead. Maya believed it was her fault because of her voice so she had stopped talking almost completely except to her brother but she had worked through it and wrote one of her most well known books “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” which is what Maya is best known for became very successful and had done many great things throughout her career like writing six more memoirs, poetry, plays, screenplays, short stories, articles, music and two cookbooks.
